In a multithreaded environment, threads often need to communicate and
coordinate with each other to accomplish a task.

Without proper communication mechanisms, threads might end up in inefficient
busy-waiting states, leading to wastage of CPU resources and potential deadlocks.

Methods introduce to thread communication:
wait
notify
notifyAll
