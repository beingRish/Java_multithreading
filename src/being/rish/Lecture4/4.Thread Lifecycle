The lifecycle of a thread in Java consists of several states,
which a thread can move through during its execution.

1. New:             A thread is in this state when it is created but not yet started.
2. Runnable:        After the start method is called, the thread becomes runnable. It's ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
3. Running:         The thread is in this state when it is executing.
4. Blocked/Waiting: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for a resources or for another thread to perform an action.
5. Terminated:      A thread is in this state when it has finished executing.
